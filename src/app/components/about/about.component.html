            <p>Hey there!</p>
            <p>I'm Marco. <strong>A (Telecommunications) engineer who found the dev world more interesting than waves and
                antennas</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>I give almost no credit to university titles. I came to realize that what makes a developer a good one, is the
                attitude of just keeping learning and experimenting in the process of building something hopefully useful.
            </p>
            <p>An objective has not a direct and unique path. <strong>Software development -as many other aspects in live-
                should not only be focused on the final goal</strong>; on answering the question: does it work? <strong>It
                should also take care of how it is done</strong>. Is it legible? Is it scalable? Does it perform as it should?
                Does it follow the standards?
            </p>
            <p>Being curious and nonconformist made me understand <strong>the importance of the journey to reach a destination,
                not only the final product. These qualities, among others, are what make a person improve everyday, every line
                of code</strong>.
            </p>

                And so, does the destination matter? Or is it the path we take? I declare that no accomplishment has substance
                nearly as great as the road used to achieve it. We are not creatures of destinations. It is the journey that
                shapes us. Our callused feet, our backs strong from carrying the weight of our travels, our eyes open with the
                fresh delight of experiences lived.
